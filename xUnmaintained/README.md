# Unmaintained samples

The samples in this directory are grouped by the latest version of Lyo they used to build and run under. Short key of guesses what can be the problem:

1. Lyo 2.2 - stuck on HP Labs Jena aka Apache Jena 2.x
1. Lyo 2.4 - stuck on Apache Wink / JAX-RS 1.1
1. Lyo 4.1 - stuck on the legacy OSLC4J Client.
